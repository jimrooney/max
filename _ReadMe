I use {name} to denote objects (in notes, not in code)
Lowercase for declared objects and Uppercase for instantiated (Class) objects.

The main worker here is an object {root} (at the root of the namespace)
Most things are functions and variables within {root}
It is created in navbar.js and then extended in root.js

I've split {root} like this as it includes instantiated classes that can only exist after the classes have loaded, but {root} needs to exist for some basic functions to work.

There is also a $() object that deals with document.querySelectors (for ease of typing/reading)
This is created in JimQuery.js

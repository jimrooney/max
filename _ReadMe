I use {name} to denote objects (in notes, not in code)
Lowercase for declared objects and Uppercase for instantiated (Class) objects.

The main worker here is an object called root (at the root of the namespace)
Most things are functions and variables within {root}

There is also a $() object that deals with document.querySelectors (for ease of typing/reading)

This is a test.

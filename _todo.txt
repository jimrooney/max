This is the trigger from drag... need to singlepoint this.
    const result = root.performance.byWeight(parameters) // do the calculations

Add in pressure.
Interpolate temperature and we're functionally complete.
Then start working on pulling in different plane data (GA8)


Still messing with root.parameters ... setting a default in performance.html...
    The last line of performance.js updateEvent() calls byWeight with parameters...
    root.performance.byWeight(parameters)...
    Maybe instead, set them to root.parameters and make the call rather than passing them?
    Then root is always reliable. Drag sets the values that get pulled since the user can override them by
        typing them in manually.


Random Stuff:
    Need to check/convert "zero" to 0 before processing (wind/alt)
    // *** Maybe set a value here so this condition can be flagged visually in the GUI ***

{ui}
dragdivs in {UI} ... thinking about setting up constraints... X / Y and constraining to a bounding div (parent?)
Will want to move the dragdivs relative to the min/max of what setting they control.

Sliders:
Click and drag sliders for changing values. Display current selected value floating next to where you're dragging.
Sliders... Aft out of limits stops calculating so it throws errors... otherwise the sliders work :)
need to add colours to out of bounds and limits to out of bounds display points (might not be neccesary to limit as you can only put so much in a seat so you can only throw it so far out of balance.)

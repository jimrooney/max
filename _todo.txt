Need to be updated to the new data structure...
    root.byWeight = function (weight) {
      const speed = root.performance.getTakeoffSpeed(root.data.test, weight)
      const groundRoll = root.performance.getGroundRoll(root.data.test, speed)
      const distance = root.performance.get50ftDistance(root.data.test, speed)

{performance}
    // Next, calculate the wind factor
    // then select the ground and takeoff data based on the wind indicies and calculate the factors.
HERE:
    // ********************************
    // Next, calculate the wind factor and interpolate the data ...
    // Collapsing the ground and takeoff data based on the wind factor leaving a flat row.
    // ********************************

{ui}
working on dragdivs in {UI} ... thinking about setting up constraints... X / Y and constraining to a bounding div (parent?)

Will want to move the dragdivs relative to the min/max of what setting they control.

Next Up...
Calculating takeoff and landing values.
Click and drag sliders for changing values. Display current selected value floating next to where you're dragging.


Sliders... Aft out of limits stops calculating so it throws errors... otherwise the sliders work :)
need to add colours to out of bounds and limits to out of bounds display points (might not be neccesary to limit as you can only put so much in a seat so you can only throw it so far out of balance.)

Need to be updated to the new data structure...
    root.byWeight = function (weight) {
      const speed = root.performance.getTakeoffSpeed(root.data.test, weight)
      const groundRoll = root.performance.getGroundRoll(root.data.test, speed)
      const distance = root.performance.get50ftDistance(root.data.test, speed)

{performance}

    // ****************************************************************
    // Needs a check here... if the values are all arrays, use array [1] values except for temp (use [0] for that)
    // ****************************************************************

    
Random Stuff:
    Need to check/convert "zero" to 0 before processing (wind/alt)
    // *** Maybe set a value here so this condition can be flagged visually in the GUI ***

{ui}
dragdivs in {UI} ... thinking about setting up constraints... X / Y and constraining to a bounding div (parent?)
Will want to move the dragdivs relative to the min/max of what setting they control.

Sliders:
Click and drag sliders for changing values. Display current selected value floating next to where you're dragging.
Sliders... Aft out of limits stops calculating so it throws errors... otherwise the sliders work :)
need to add colours to out of bounds and limits to out of bounds display points (might not be neccesary to limit as you can only put so much in a seat so you can only throw it so far out of balance.)

Move most of {root}.update() into {root}.setPlane()
Set the fuel selector to "standard fuel" in {root}.setPlane()

Need to be updated to the new data structure...
    root.byWeight = function (weight) {
      const speed = root.performance.getTakeoffSpeed(root.data.test, weight)
      const groundRoll = root.performance.getGroundRoll(root.data.test, speed)
      const distance = root.performance.get50ftDistance(root.data.test, speed)

{performance}
    // Next, calculate the wind factor
    // then select the ground and takeoff data based on the wind indicies and calculate the factors.
HERE:

    Wind top value borked
    Need to check/convert "zero" to 0 before processing
    Data is being collapsed, cuttion the pressureAltitude to two elements.
    It needs to be left alone because we're going to use it later.
    Need to check to make sure that all the PA data is interpolated.

    // We are here ****************************************************************
    // This is where we'll interpolate the data based on temperature and altitude
    // Currently we assume sealevel and standard temperature
    // Find an flatten the preassureAltitude row with an alt of 0

dragdivs in {UI} ... thinking about setting up constraints... X / Y and constraining to a bounding div (parent?)
Will want to move the dragdivs relative to the min/max of what setting they control.

Sliders:
Click and drag sliders for changing values. Display current selected value floating next to where you're dragging.
Sliders... Aft out of limits stops calculating so it throws errors... otherwise the sliders work :)
need to add colours to out of bounds and limits to out of bounds display points (might not be neccesary to limit as you can only put so much in a seat so you can only throw it so far out of balance.)

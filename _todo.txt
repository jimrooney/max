Need to be updated to the new data structure...
    root.byWeight = function (weight) {
      const speed = root.performance.getTakeoffSpeed(root.data.test, weight)
      const groundRoll = root.performance.getGroundRoll(root.data.test, speed)
      const distance = root.performance.get50ftDistance(root.data.test, speed)

{performance}
HERE:

Likely same problem with the wind ratio calculator...
// if 0 gap, means it's the top value, so use that.
   Proably same issue ---> All wind values below 10kts report out of bounds :(

    
    // ************** Change this to be the value of the text input field ****************************
    const targetAltitude = 2500 // *** for testing ********************************

          // then collapse the rows by extracting interpolated data from them based on targetAltitude
      // ********************************


    // We are here ****************************************************************
    // This is where we'll interpolate the data based on temperature and altitude
    // Currently we assume sealevel and standard temperature
    // Find an flatten the preassureAltitude row with an alt of 0

    
Random Stuff:
    Need to check/convert "zero" to 0 before processing (wind/alt)
    // *** Maybe set a value here so this condition can be flagged visually in the GUI ***

dragdivs in {UI} ... thinking about setting up constraints... X / Y and constraining to a bounding div (parent?)
Will want to move the dragdivs relative to the min/max of what setting they control.

Sliders:
Click and drag sliders for changing values. Display current selected value floating next to where you're dragging.
Sliders... Aft out of limits stops calculating so it throws errors... otherwise the sliders work :)
need to add colours to out of bounds and limits to out of bounds display points (might not be neccesary to limit as you can only put so much in a seat so you can only throw it so far out of balance.)

Move most of {root}.update() into {root}.setPlane()
Set the fuel selector to "standard fuel" in {root}.setPlane()

/*
in {Airpalne}
figure out if we should return fwd1 or fwd2 as forward limit for Caravans
If the weight is below fwd1's weight, then return the absolute fwd limit.


No idea why this file is .js

Currently.
Working in test.html so as not to mess with the working index.html

Next Up...
Calculating takeoff and landing values.
Click and drag sliders for changing values. Display current selected value floating next to where you're dragging.


Sliders... Aft out of limits stops calculating so it throws errors... otherwise the sliders work :)
need to add colours to out of bounds and limits to out of bounds display points (might not be neccesary to limit as you can only put so much in a seat so you can only throw it so far out of balance.)
